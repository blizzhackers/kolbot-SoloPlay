# The big question, What is Kolbot-SoloPlay?
- SoloPlay is a D2BS based auto-play system to level any single legacy diablo 2 character class from 1-99. That sounds like a bunch of verbage so let me break it down a bit. D2BS stands for ``Diablo 2 Botting System`` if you are familiar with Kolbot that is what you are using. SoloPlay only works for Diablo 2, so before you ask it is not for Diablo 2 Resurrected. Alright next, what is an auto-play system? In simple terms, SoloPlay works by set it and forget philosophy. It is profile driven so the only thing you need to worry about is filling out the profile with the correct format and then press start (how to set up the profile is defined below). After that it takes care of the rest, no setting up config files or settings files (like sonic or horde), ect. The goal is to be the fastest leveling system there is across all modes (classic/expansion, hardcore/softcore, ladder/non-ladder)

## **Important Notes:** 
- This script is designed to be only run from [https://github.com/blizzhackers/kolbot](https://github.com/blizzhackers/kolbot). Most errors occur from using the wrong Kolbot repo installation. 
- **This script requires the English version of Diablo 2 to be installed.**

# Features
- Operates in Hell difficulty within 24 hours (the exception is the barbarian class that takes 48)
  - **NOTE:** Classic mode will take a little longer
- Final build options, or what the bot will build to (I.E Light sorceress, Hammerdin, ect) (see **[Frequently Asked Questions](#frequently-asked-questions)** for more info)
- Plays through and finishes the game
- Hire class/build specific mercenary
- Fully configured Auto Equip (Primary, Secondary, and Charms) for bot and mercenary
- Makes and equips CTA and spirit shield on swap
    - **NOTE:** Some classes don't use CTA and spirit:
      - Barbarian class uses duel Bo sticks.
      - Cold based sorceress builds use CTA and Lidless for the lower strength requirment.
      - Wereform druid builds use Mang-Songs Staff for the +5 all skills bonus. 
- Fully configured use of socketable items for both leveling gear and end-game gear (Adding Perfect diamonds to a shield like Moser's and later replacing it with Um runes if it's our wanted end-game gear) (see **Config.socketables** inside the base config file for more info)
- Kill diablo clone in expansion
  - Will try to share Annhilus charm if online and already has one

# Frequently Asked Questions
### **Q: Why isn't the bot making the build I selected?**

**A:** The bot follows a set build progression. See next question.

### **Q: When will the bot change to the final build I selected?**

**A:** In classic, the bot will switch to the final build after it defeats diablo and meets a level requirement.
In expansion, it transitions to the final build when final gear requirements are met ``(Navigate to libs\SoloPlay\``[``BuildFiles\``](libs/SoloPlay/BuildFiles/)) and look for the file with the name of the final build you choose to see what items are needed for each build and what level is required for classic.

### **Q: The bot has beaten diablo (classic) / baal, so why isn't moving on to the next difficulty?**

**A:** The bot will only progress once it has reached a minimum character level (``navigate to libs\SoloPlay\``[``BuildFiles``](libs/SoloPlay/BuildFiles/)``\classname\classname.js`` and see `CharInfo.levelCap` for level requirments) and will not start the next difficulty with negative resistances. If the bot is more than 5 levels higher than the minimum character level and has not reached the required resistances, it will automatically move to the next difficulty.

### **Q: How can I run more than one of the same class?**

**A:** Simply append a number after the class name. For example, if you want to run 5 sorceresses just name the profiles: `SCL-SORC-1`, `SCL-SORC-2`, `SCL-SORC-3`, `SCL-SORC-4`, `SCL-SORC-5`. Example Profile Names are listed at the bottom of the install guide.

### **Q: HELP!!! There is an error when starting the bot?**

**A:** There was a bad installation OR the profile settings are wrong. First verify that you using the kolbot version linked the install guide below. Next, confirm you have installed all the files into their proper locations (including overwriting the existing `default.dbj`). Finally, verify the profile name and infotag follow the format of the install guide's instructions.

### **Q: HELP!!! The bot auto created my account and I can't find the password!**

**A:** The info for each character created is saved under logs/Kolbot-SoloPlay/realm/ , look for the name of the character whos info you're trying to find and open up the .json file. 

### **Q: HELP!!! The bot isn't casting any skills!**

**A:** The bot uses packet casting for stability, which doesn't show the casting animations. It is actually casting the skills, if you would like to see the casting animations you will need to navigate to `libs\SoloPlay\Tools\`[Developer.js](libs/SoloPlay/Tools/Developer.js) and change forcePacketCasting.enabled to false.

### **Q: What is a Bumper?**

**A:** A Bumper is a level 40 character that has not done baal quest in normal and is used to "bump" low level characters to hell difficulty where they can power level following chaos runs. 

### **Q: Does this work for Diablo 2 Resurected?**

**A:** No, Kolbot does not work with d2r and SoloPlay runs using Kolbot. SoloPlay only works on diablo 2. 

## Really Dumb Frequently Asked Questions
### **Q: Can I make my solo bots work together?**

**A:** NO. It is SOLO not team, not group, but SoloPlay

## Brief History
Kolbot-SoloPlay was built off the base structure of SoloLeveling by isid0re. Autoplay scripts/systems aren't a new concept, some to note are sonic, autoplay, and AutoSorc. None of the existing ones were able to do other character classes though so SoloLeveling was created by modding Questing.js. Almost from the beginning, Isid0re and I were bouncing ideas off each other. At that time, I was working on a separate project. We discussed ideas that helped both of our projects. I officially joined in around 4 months or so after the Github repo went public and was actively involved in the project until 6/30/2021. I contributed updates including but not limited to: item based respec, the overlay, logging equipped items, showing tier values on items, many bug fixes, sorting, D2BotSoloCleaner, performance tracking, ect. Due to some personal conflicts between isid0re and myself, I decided to create GuysSoloLeveling to have all of my ideas in one place. On 6/30/2021 I created this repo and on 7/13/2021 I made it public. On 9/1/2021, I changed the name to Kolbot-SoloPlay after some major changes in structure and continue to update to make SoloPlay the best leveling system for legacy diablo 2.
