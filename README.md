- Note: These two options only work in expansion.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: Why isn't the bot making the build I selected?**

**A:** The bot follows a set build progression. As it progresses, it will respecialize 2 times transitioning from a start build to a leveling build, ending at the selected finalbuild.

**Q: When will the bot change to the final build I selected?**

**A:** In classic the bot will switch to the final build based on level. In expansion it transitions to the final build when final gear requirements are met.

**Q: The bot has beaten diablo (classic) / baal, so why isn't moving on to the next difficulty?**

**A:** The bot will only progress once it has reached a minimum minimum character level (33 for normal and 65 for nightmare) and will not start the next difficulty with negative resistances. If the bot is more than 5 levels higher than the minimum character level and has not reached the required resistances, it will automatically move to the next difficulty.

**Q: How can I run more than one of the same class?**

**A:** Simply append a number after the class name. For example, if you want to run 5 sorceresses just name the profiles: `SCL-SORC-1`, `SCL-SORC-2`, `SCL-SORC-3`, `SCL-SORC-4`, `SCL-SORC-5`. Example Profile Names are listed at the bottom of the install guide.

**Q: HELP!!! There an error when starting the bot?**

**A:** There was a bad installation OR the profile settings are wrong. First verify that you using the kolbot version linked the install guide below. Next, confirm you have installed all the files into their proper locations (including overwriting the existing `_customconfig.js` and `default.dbj`). Finally, verify the profile name and infotag follow the format of the install guide's instructions.

## Really Dumb Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: Can I make my solo bots work together?**

**A:** NO. It is SOLO not team, not group, but SoloLeveling
